# 9. Use the GPL (version 3) license

Date: 2019-10-03

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to choose an appropriate license before making Maud public. The main
contenders are the Apache license, which would allow others to use Maud in
proprietary software, and the GPL v3 license, which would not.

## Decision

We will use the GPL license but may change to a more permissive license in a
future release, depending on the circumstances at the time.

## Consequences

We may lose out on contributions from people who would want to use Maud in
proprietary software.
