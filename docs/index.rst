Welcome to Maud's documentation!
================================

Maud is a command-line application that fits Bayesian statistical models of
metabolic networks using Python and Stan.

Maud aims to take into account allosteric effects, ensure that the laws of
thermodynamics are obeyed and to synthesise information from both steady state
experiments and the existing literature.
