  abstract = {Standard Gibbs energies of reactions are increasingly being used in metabolic modeling for applying thermodynamic constraints on reaction rates, metabolite concentrations and kinetic parameters. The increasing scope and diversity of metabolic models has led scientists to look for genome-scale solutions that can estimate the standard Gibbs energy of all the reactions in metabolism. Group contribution methods greatly increase coverage, albeit at the price of decreased precision. We present here a way to combine the estimations of group contribution with the more accurate reactant contributions by decomposing each reaction into two parts and applying one of the methods on each of them. This method gives priority to the reactant contributions over group contributions while guaranteeing that all estimations will be consistent, i.e. will not violate the first law of thermodynamics. We show that there is a significant increase in the accuracy of our estimations compared to standard group contribution. Specifically, our cross-validation results show an 80\% reduction in the median absolute residual for reactions that can be derived by reactant contributions only. We provide the full framework and source code for deriving estimates of standard reaction Gibbs energy, as well as confidence intervals, and believe this will facilitate the wide use of thermodynamic data for a better understanding of metabolism.},

While the website now counts \$\{\textbackslash sim\}1000\$ distinct monthly users, its design could not accommodate larger compound databases and it lacked an application programming interface (API) for integration in other tools developed by the systems biology community. Here, we report a new python-based package for eQuilibrator, that comes with many new features such as a 50-fold larger compound database, the ability to add novel compound structures, improvements in speed and memory use, and correction for Mg2+ ion concentrations. Moreover, it adds the ability to compute the covariance matrix of the uncertainty between estimates, for which we show the advantages and describe the application in metabolic modeling. We foresee that these improvements will make thermodynamic modeling more accessible and facilitate the integration of eQuilibrator into other software platforms.},

  abstract = {Recent technological advances have enabled comprehensive determination of the molecular composition of living cells. The chemical interactions between many of these molecules are known, giving rise to genome-scale reconstructed biochemical reaction networks underlying cellular functions. Mathematical descriptions of the totality of these chemical interactions lead to genome-scale models that allow the computation of physiological functions. Reflecting these recent developments, this textbook explains how such quantitative and computable genotype-phenotype relationships are built using a genome-wide basis of information about the gene portfolio of a target organism. It describes how biological knowledge is assembled to reconstruct biochemical reaction networks, the formulation of computational models of biological functions, and how these models can be used to address key biological questions and enable predictive biology. Developed through extensive classroom use, the book is designed to provide students with a solid conceptual framework and an invaluable set of modeling tools and computational approaches.},

  abstract = {Modern biological tools generate a wealth of data on metabolite and protein concentrations that can be used to help inform new strain designs. However, integrating these data sources to generate predictions of steady-state metabolism typically requires a kinetic description of the enzymatic reactions that occur within a cell. Parameterizing these kinetic models from biological data can be computationally difficult, especially as the amount of data increases. Robust methods must also be able to quantify the uncertainty in model parameters as a function of the available data, which can be particularly computationally intensive. The field of Bayesian inference offers a wide range of methods for estimating distributions in parameter uncertainty. However, these techniques are poorly suited to kinetic metabolic modeling due to the complex kinetic rate laws typically employed and the resulting dynamic system that must be solved. In this paper, we employ linear-logarithmic kinetics to simplify the calculation of steady-state flux distributions and enable efficient sampling and variational inference methods. We demonstrate that detailed information on the posterior distribution of kinetic model parameters can be obtained efficiently at a variety of different problem scales, including large-scale kinetic models trained on multiomics datasets. These results allow modern Bayesian machine learning tools to be leveraged in understanding biological data and developing new, efficient strain designs.},

The information is manually extracted from primary literature and extended by text mining procedures, integration of external data and prediction algorithms. Approximately 3 million data from 83 000 enzymes and 137 000 literature references constitute the manually annotated core. Text mining procedures extend these data with information on occurrence, enzyme-disease relationships and kinetic data. Prediction algorithms contribute locations and genome annotations. External data and links complete the data with sequences and 3D structures. A total of 206 000 enzyme ligands provide functional and structural data. BRENDA offers a complex query tool engine allowing the users an efficient access to the data via different search methods and explorers. The new design of the BRENDA entry page and the enzyme summary pages improves the user access and the performance. New interactive and intuitive BRENDA pathway maps give an overview on biochemical processes and facilitate the visualization of enzyme, ligand and organism information in the biochemical context. SCOPe and CATH, databases for protein structure classification, are included. New online and video tutorials provide online training for the users. BRENDA is freely available for academic users.}

In particular, I show the algebraic system we solve can be quite complex and embed, for instance, numerical solutions to ordinary differential equations.
