Maud is a work-in-progress application that fits Bayesian statistical models of
metabolic networks using `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ and `Stan
<https://mc-stan.org>`_.

Maud aims to take into account allosteric effects, ensure that the laws of
thermodynamics are obeyed and to synthesise information from both steady state
experiments and the existing literature.

Install
=======
First create a fresh Python virtual environment and then activate it:

.. code-block:: console

    python -m venv .venv --prompt=maud
    source .venv/bin/activate

To install Maud and its python dependencies to your new virtual environment, run
this command:

.. code-block:: console

    pip install maud-metabolic-models

Cmdstanpy depends on `cmdstan <https://github.com/stan-dev/cmdstan>`_, 
which in turn requires a c++ toolchain. Fortunately, cmdstanpy comes with
commands that can install these for you. On windows the necessary dependencies 
can be installed with the following powershell commands:

.. code-block:: console

    python -m cmdstanpy.install_cxx_toolchain
    python -m cmdstanpy.install_cmdstan --compiler

On macos or Linux, you must install the c++ requirements manually 
(see [here](https://cmdstanpy.readthedocs.io/en/v0.9.67/installation.html#install-cmdstan)) for instuctions. 
Cmdstan can then be installed using this shell command:

.. code-block:: console

    install_cmdstan

Usage
=====
To run the simple linear model, use the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    maud sample

This will compile the Stan program at `src/maud/inference_model.stan
<https://github.com/biosustain/Maud/blob/master/src/maud/inference_model.stan>`_, 
then run the resulting binary file using the data at `src/maud/data/example_inputs/linear
<https://github.com/biosustain/Maud/blob/master/src/maud/data/example_inputs/linear>`_, storing
the results in a folder whose name starts with
:code:`model_output_linear`.

The `sample` command can be configured in a few ways - to check out all the
options try running

.. code-block:: console

    maud sample --help
